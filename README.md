Examples of Professional and Personal projects in Python 


# Data Analysis Example:
This project took data from the climbing website:
https://www.8a.nu/

In this folder we see part of this analysis in which the BMI of climbers around Europe is compared to that of the general population. This is done for the European countries in which for which there is the most data available on climbers. The results are divided between males and females:

# Quantum Metrology
In this project we see an example of some code used to produce results for the published paper:
https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/aac30b

The main interest of this code is the simulated evolution of quantum mechaical states:
