# Python-Showcase
Examples of Professional and Personal projects in Python 


# Data Analysis Example:
This project took data from the climbing website:
https://www.8a.nu/

In this folder we see part of this analysis in which the BMI of climbers around Europe is compared to that of the general population. This is done for the European countries in which for which there is the most data available on climbers. The results are divided between males and females:

# Quantum Metrology
In this project we see an example of some code used to produce results for the published paper:
https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/aac30b

The main interest of this code is the simulated evolution of quantum mechaical states: 
https://github.com/anthayes92/Python-Showcase/blob/master/Quanutm%20Metrology/state_evolution.py

and the numerical optimisations of these processes which generate the data to be analysed:

# SF quantum state learning
This project uses software developed by Xanadu called Strawberryfields:
https://strawberryfields.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Here I use machine learning optimisation algorithms, provided by the TensorFlow backend, to engineer continous variable states of particular interest to quantum metrology. The continous variable states can be found here:
https://github.com/anthayes92/Python-Showcase/blob/master/SF%20quantum%20state%20learning%20/learner/cv_states.py

The state of interest is the so called "squeezed entangled state" which has been shown to exhibit high presicion gains for applications such as gravitational wave detection:
